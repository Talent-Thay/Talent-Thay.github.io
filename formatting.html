			The <abbr title = "Secure Contain Protect">SCP</abbr> Foundation is a secret branch of the government that seeks to secure 
			anomlies<dfn> (objects, enetities, or phenomena that do not belong and/or make sense)</dfn>, contain the anomly from escaping
			or activating and protect the general public from being affected by it. Once an anomly is cointained or identified it is 
			then given an SCP number and a cotainment level such as SCP 173 which is a Euclid SCP statue made of concrete and spary paint.
			SCP 173 can <strong> only move when not observed, even for a split second.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The cotainment level of the SCP is <em>not determined by how dangerous, but by how difficult it is to contain.</em> 
			A simple way to test an SCP's cotainment level is the box test. Put an SCP in a box and it stays in the box it probably safe
			<dfn>(takes very little resources to cointain SCP)</dfn>,if you put it in a box and you don't know what will happen 
			it's probably a Euclid <dfn> (an SCP that takes moderate amount of resources to cointain or you don't understand yet)</dfn>
			and if you put it inside an SCP a box and it easily leaves the box, it's a Keter<dfn> (An SCP that takes a massive amount of 
			resources to cointain or can't be contained)</dfn>, and the box would a Thaumiel class.<dfn> (An SCP that is used to help contain
			other SCPs)</dfn>
		</p>
		<p>
			The SCP Foundation is just a giant community that creates their own anomalies on the <a href = "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com" target = "_blank">SCP Wiki</a>,
			but wouldn't that be the perfect cover, as the saying goes <q> The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist.</q>
